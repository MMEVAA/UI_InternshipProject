- **JIRA & Zephyr-Squad** - Test management tools
- **Page Object Model (POM)** - Test automation pattern
- **Safari, Firefox, Google Chrome** - Web browsers used in testing

## Project Requirements
1. **Page Object Model (POM)**: The POM design pattern is used for structuring the test cases.

2. **Parallel Testing**: Tests are executed in parallel on Chrome and Firefox browsers.

3. **XML Configuration**: Test cases are executed from an XML file.

4. **Smoke and Regression Testing**: Separate XML files are created for smoke and regression testing.

5. **Live Environment Considerations**: To keep the environment clean after testing, "test" is included in the name and email fields, and the country is set to "Argentina".
